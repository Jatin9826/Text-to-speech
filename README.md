TEXT TO SPEECH USING #HTML #CSS #JAVA-SCRIPT



1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**: Ensure you have a text editor and a browser for testing. You might also need a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

2. **Create a Project Folder**: Organize your files in a dedicated folder. This keeps everything related to your project in one place.

3. **HTML Structure**: Create an HTML file (`index.html`) and set up the basic structure of the document. This includes the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

4. **Add Meta Tags**: Inside the `<head>` tag, include meta tags for character set and viewport settings to ensure proper rendering on different devices.

5. **Title and External CSS**: Set the title of your webpage within the `<title>` tag. Link an external CSS file (`textspeech.css`) to style your elements.

6. **Main Container**: Create a `<div>` element with a class of "container" to wrap your project content. This container will help with styling and layout.

7. **Header and Text Area**: Inside the container, add an `<h1>` heading with the title of your project. Below that, include a `<textarea>` element for users to input their text.

8. **Speak Button**: Add a `<button>` element with an onclick event calling a JavaScript function (`textToAudio()`). This button will trigger the conversion of text to speech.

9. **JavaScript Logic**: Create a JavaScript file (`textspeech.js`) and define the `textToAudio()` function. This function retrieves the text from the textarea, creates a `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` object, and speaks the text using `speechSynthesis.speak()`.

10. **Set Speech Parameters**: Customize the speech parameters like language, volume, rate, and pitch according to your preference or requirements.

11. **CSS Styling**: Open the `textspeech.css` file and define the styles for various elements. This includes styling for the container, text area, button, and any other elements you want to customize.

12. **Reset Default Styles**: Use CSS to reset default styles with `*{}` to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.

13. **Positioning and Layout**: Apply CSS rules to position the container in the center of the page using absolute positioning and the transform property.

14. **Background Styling**: Customize the background of the container using a linear gradient or any other background properties you prefer.

15. **Button Interaction**: Style the button with CSS to provide visual feedback on hover or click events, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
